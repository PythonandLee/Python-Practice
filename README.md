# Python-Practice
# Hello Worlds!
Start self-studying Python since January 2019, and here will contain all practice 'py.' files. I am a total beginner to Pytohn, and never learn any other coding languages before. My purpose of learning Python is using it for Data Science, especially in environmental field.
