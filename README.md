# Hello Worlds! # Python-Practice
Start self-studying Python since January 2019, and here will contain all practice 'py.' files. I am Lee, a total beginner to Pytohn, and never learned any other coding languages before. My purpose of learning Python is using it for Data Science, especially in environmental field. Below is the textbook I use, Python Crash Course, and I already enjoyed the first two chapters. This book is easy to understand, and teach step by step. It is a really useful book!
